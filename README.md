# üìö Minimal Library Management System

A clean and modern client-side application for managing a small library. This project allows users to view a list of books, perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, borrow books, and view a summary of borrowed items.

**Live Demo:** https://assignment-4-phl2.vercel.app/

## ‚ú® Features

This project implements all the core requirements of a minimal library system:

- **Full Book Management**: A complete CRUD interface for managing the book inventory.
  - **Create**: Add new books to the library through a type-safe form.
  - **Read**: View all books in a responsive table and see detailed information on a dedicated page for each book.
  - **Update**: Edit existing book information with pre-filled forms.
  - **Delete**: Remove books from the system with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion.
- **Borrowing System**:
  - Users can borrow available books using a simple form.
  - The system validates that the borrow quantity does not exceed available copies.
  - The book's availability status is automatically updated based on the number of copies.
- **Borrow Summary**: A dedicated page that displays an aggregated summary of all borrowed books, showing the total quantity borrowed for each title.
- **Responsive Design**: The entire user interface is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **User-Friendly Notifications**: Toast notifications (using Sonner) provide clear feedback for actions like creating, updating, or deleting books.
- **Type-Safe Forms**: All forms are built with `react-hook-form` and `zod` for robust, type-safe validation, ensuring data integrity.
